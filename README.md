# Streamify

Streamify is a music video streaming application that allows you to listen to your favorite artists as well as discover new ones. The application is built with the user experience in mind so it is all dynamic to allow the user an uninterrupted listening experience.

 It uses the EchoNest API to grab the artist and video information with a lightweight Ruby/Sinatra backend. The rest of the page is composed of Javascript (jQuery, jQuery-UI, AJAX) and HTML/CSS. The search & play logic is based on the user's favorite artists and exploration of new ones similar to those artists. On of my stretch goals is to build an iOS version using Swift.
